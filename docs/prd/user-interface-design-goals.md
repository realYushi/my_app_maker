# User Interface Design Goals

*   **Overall UX Vision:** The user experience should be minimalist, immediate, and intuitive. The journey from entering text to seeing a visual mock-up should feel like a single, seamless action. The interface should prioritize clarity and simplicity over feature-richness, providing just enough structure to make an abstract idea feel tangible.
*   **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The primary interaction is a single-form submission. The user types, clicks "Generate," and the UI appears. There are no other primary interactions in the MVP.
*   **Core Screens and Views:**
    *   **Input Screen:** A single view containing the text input area and a "Generate" button.
    *   **Output View:** The same view, which will update to display the generated mock UI, including the extracted requirements and the visual prototype.
*   **Accessibility:** WCAG AA. While this is a mock-up tool, we should adhere to standard accessibility practices from the start.
*   **Branding:** None specified. The UI should be clean, neutral, and unbranded, using a standard design system or simple CSS to avoid distracting from the user's generated concept.
*   **Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive. The application should be usable on both desktop and mobile web browsers.

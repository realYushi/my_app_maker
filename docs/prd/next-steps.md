# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"Please review the PRD located at `docs/prd.md` and create a simple, clean wireframe or visual design concept for the 'Mini AI App Builder'. The design should focus on the single-page user flow: text input -> generate -> mock UI display. Pay close attention to the 'User Interface Design Goals' section."

## Architect Prompt
"Please review the completed PRD at `docs/prd.md`. Your task is to create a technical architecture document for the 'Mini AI App Builder' MVP. The architecture should adhere to all constraints and requirements outlined in the PRD, including the technology stack, repository structure, and the newly added security, reliability, and operational requirements. Please produce a document that is ready for a developer to begin implementation."

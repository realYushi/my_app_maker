# Epic 1: Core AI-to-UI Generation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-15)

**Goal:** This epic will establish the project's foundational infrastructure and deliver the complete end-to-end user experience of converting a text description into a visual, non-functional mock UI. It starts with setting up the backend to handle AI-based requirement extraction and culminates in a dynamic frontend that renders a mock application based on that output.

## Epic Summary

**Completion Date:** September 15, 2025
**Total Stories:** 5 (All completed)
**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Full backend infrastructure with AI integration (Gemini API)
- ✅ Complete frontend application with responsive design
- ✅ End-to-end user experience from text input to mock UI generation
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (81 tests passing)
- ✅ Production-ready code with QA approval

**Story 1.1: Backend Service Setup**
*As a developer, I want to set up a basic Node.js server with a single API endpoint, so that I have a foundation for handling future requests from the frontend.*

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A Node.js project is initialized with necessary dependencies (e.g., Express).
    2.  A single POST endpoint (e.g., `/api/generate`) is created.
    3.  When the endpoint receives a request, it returns a hardcoded JSON response that mimics the expected structure (App Name, Entities, Roles, Features).
    4.  A basic unit test is in place to verify the endpoint returns the correct mock response and a 200 status code.

**Story 1.2: AI Requirement Extraction**
*As a developer, I want to integrate the backend service with an LLM API, so that I can send a user's text description and receive a structured JSON object of extracted requirements.*

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The backend service securely connects to a chosen LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
    2.  The `/api/generate` endpoint takes a text string from the request body.
    3.  A well-defined prompt is engineered to instruct the LLM to extract the App Name, Entities, Roles, and Features, and to return them in a specific JSON format.
    4.  The service successfully calls the LLM API with the user's text and returns the structured JSON output.
    5.  Error handling is implemented for failed API calls to the LLM.

**Story 1.3: Basic Frontend Application Setup**
*As a developer, I want to create a basic React application with a simple UI, so that a user has a place to enter their app description.*

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A new React project is created using a standard tool (e.g., Create React App, Vite).
    2.  The main view contains a text area input field and a "Generate" button.
    3.  A state management solution is in place to hold the user's input.
    4.  The application is styled with a clean, neutral look.

---

**Story 1.4: Frontend-Backend Integration**
*As a user, I want to click the "Generate" button and have my app description sent to the backend, so that the AI processing can begin.*

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  When the "Generate" button is clicked, a `fetch` or `axios` request is made to the backend's `/api/generate` endpoint.
    2.  The text from the input area is included in the request body.
    3.  The frontend application correctly receives the JSON response from the backend.
    4.  The received JSON data is stored in the application's state.
    5.  A loading indicator is displayed to the user while the request is in progress.

---

**Story 1.5: Dynamic UI Generation**
*As a user, I want to see a mock UI rendered on the screen based on the requirements extracted by the AI, so that I can visualize my app idea.*

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The extracted App Name is displayed as a title on the page.
    2.  A navigation menu or tab bar is dynamically created with items for each extracted Role and Feature.
    3.  For each extracted Entity, a non-functional form is rendered on the page, containing a generic set of input fields.
    4.  The entire generated UI replaces or appears alongside the initial text input area.
    5.  The display is responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile screens.
    6.  If the backend returns an error, a user-friendly error message is displayed instead of the mock UI.

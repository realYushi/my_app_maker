# Requirements

## Functional
*   **FR1:** The system shall provide a simple text area for the user to enter a natural language description of their desired application.
*   **FR2:** The system shall use an AI backend service to process the text and extract a proposed App Name, a list of Entities (data objects), a list of User Roles, and a list of core Features.
*   **FR3:** The system shall display the extracted requirements (App Name, Entities, Roles, Features) back to the user after processing.
*   **FR4:** The system shall dynamically render a mock user interface based on the extracted requirements.
*   **FR5:** The generated UI shall contain a basic, non-functional form for each identified Entity.
*   **FR6:** The generated UI shall feature a simple navigation menu or tab bar corresponding to the identified Roles and Features.

## Non-Functional
*   **NFR1:** The median time from text submission to UI render shall be under 10 seconds.
*   **NFR2:** The application shall be supported on modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
*   **NFR3:** All generated UI components in the MVP (e.g., forms, buttons) will be for display purposes only and will not be functional.
*   **NFR4:** The MVP will not include user accounts, project saving, or manual editing of the AI-extracted requirements.
*   **NFR5:** The technology stack is constrained to React (frontend), Node.js (backend), and MongoDB (database).

## Security Requirements
*   **NFR6:** The `/api/generate` endpoint shall be rate-limited to 10 requests per minute per IP address to prevent abuse.

## Reliability Requirements
*   **NFR7:** If the LLM API is unavailable or fails, the system shall return a user-friendly error message to the client within 15 seconds.

# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Validate market demand for an AI-powered, text-to-mock-UI tool.
*   Achieve 100 successful UI generations within the first month of launch.
*   Enable a user to successfully generate a UI that they feel accurately represents their initial idea.
*   Encourage users to share the generated UI with colleagues or friends for feedback.
*   Maintain a UI generation success rate greater than 70%.
*   Achieve a median time-to-UI of less than 10 seconds.

## Background Context

Currently, non-technical founders and innovators face significant barriers when trying to visualize their application ideas. Translating a concept into even a basic wireframe is slow, requires specialized tools, and can be costly. Existing solutions are often too complex for simple, rapid validation, causing many promising ideas to be abandoned before they can be explored.

This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a web portal that instantly generates a mock user interface from a simple text description. By allowing a user to describe their desired application in natural language, our system will use AI to extract key requirements and build a non-functional, visual prototype. The core vision is to provide the fastest possible path from an idea to a tangible, shareable concept, enabling rapid validation and early feedback.

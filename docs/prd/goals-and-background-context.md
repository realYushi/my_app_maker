# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

### Primary Goals (Intern Evaluation)
* Demonstrate proficiency in React, Node.js, and AI integration
* Successfully implement text-to-UI generation pipeline
* Showcase clean code architecture and testing practices
* Deploy a functional application meeting all specified requirements

### Secondary Goals (Portfolio Enhancement)
* Validate market demand for AI-powered, text-to-mock-UI tools
* Achieve robust UI generation success rate (>95%)
* Enable rapid prototyping for non-technical stakeholders
* Create reusable component generation patterns

## Background Context

### Project Origin
This project originated as an intern evaluation task requiring a simple AI-powered app builder. During development, the technical foundation proved robust enough to support a more comprehensive solution, leading to a dual-purpose approach.

### Technical Challenge
The core challenge involves bridging natural language processing with dynamic UI generation. While existing solutions require specialized knowledge, this implementation demonstrates how AI can democratize rapid prototyping while maintaining code quality and architectural excellence.

### Implementation Approach
The solution balances simplicity (for evaluation requirements) with sophistication (for portfolio demonstration), showcasing progressive enhancement from MVP to advanced features. This approach addresses both immediate evaluation needs and long-term portfolio value.

# Story 1.3: Basic Frontend Application Setup

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a basic React application with a simple UI,
**so that** a user has a place to enter their app description.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new React project is created using a standard tool (e.g., Create React App, Vite).
2. The main view contains a text area input field and a "Generate" button.
3. A state management solution is in place to hold the user's input.
4. The application is styled with a clean, neutral look.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create React application structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Initialize React project using Vite in `apps/web/` directory
  - [x] Configure TypeScript and shared types integration
  - [x] Set up Tailwind CSS for styling
  - [x] Configure Vite build configuration for monorepo
- [x] Task 2: Implement main UI components (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Create main `App.tsx` component with text area and Generate button
  - [x] Implement clean, neutral styling using Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Create feature-based folder structure in `src/features/generation`
  - [x] Add responsive design for desktop and mobile
- [x] Task 3: Implement state management (AC: 3)
  - [x] Set up React Context API for application state management
  - [x] Create state context with idle/loading/success/error states
  - [x] Implement user input state management
  - [x] Connect UI components to state management
- [x] Task 4: Add comprehensive unit testing (Testing Requirements)
  - [x] Create Vitest test configuration
  - [x] Add unit tests for main components using Vitest and React Testing Library
  - [x] Test state management context and hooks
  - [x] Verify responsive design behavior

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Backend API with POST /api/generate endpoint is functional and tested [Source: 1.2.story.md#Dev Agent Record]
- GenerationResult interface is available in shared-types package [Source: 1.2.story.md#Dev Notes]
- Monorepo structure is established with packages/shared-types [Source: 1.1.story.md, 1.2.story.md]

### Data Models

**GenerationResult Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#GenerationResult]:

```typescript
export interface GenerationResult {
  appName: string;
  entities: Entity[];
  userRoles: UserRole[];
  features: Feature[];
}
```

**Supporting Interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:

- Entity: { name: string; attributes: string[]; }
- UserRole: { name: string; description: string; }
- Feature: { name: string; description: string; }

**Shared Types Location** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]: These types are already defined in `packages/shared-types` package and must be imported.

### API Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### Component Specifications

**Frontend Application Structure** [Source: architecture/components.md#Frontend Application]:

- React SPA that renders the UI and communicates with the API
- Feature-based folder structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]
- Root `App.tsx` component conditionally renders views based on application state
- No routing library needed for MVP

**State Management** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State Management]:

- React Context API for minimal global state management
- Application states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`
- No external state management library required

**Services Layer** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Services Layer]:

- Dedicated service layer (`src/services`) must abstract all `fetch` calls
- Components MUST NOT call `fetch` directly [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#API Calls]

### File Locations

**Frontend Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Frontend React application in `apps/web/` directory

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

- Components MUST NOT call `fetch` directly; must use service layer [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#API Calls]
- Standard naming conventions: PascalCase for components/types, camelCase for functions/variables [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming]

### Testing

**Test Framework**: Vitest (~1.x) for React components and hooks [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test Location**: Standard Vitest conventions in `apps/web/src/__tests__/` directory or co-located
**Test Requirements**:

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - This implementation demonstrates high-quality React development with proper architecture patterns, comprehensive testing, and adherence to coding standards. The developer successfully created a complete frontend application following all specified requirements and technical constraints.

### Refactoring Performed

**Shared Types Integration:**
- **File**: `src/types/index.ts`
  - **Change**: Replaced local type definitions with imports from `@mini-ai-app-builder/shared-types`
  - **Why**: Enforces coding standards requirement that shared types MUST be imported from packages/shared-types
  - **How**: Added workspace dependency and re-exported types for consistency

**Service Layer Improvements:**
- **File**: `src/services/generationService.ts`
  - **Change**: Added configurable API URL via environment variables and enhanced error handling
  - **Why**: Improves maintainability and provides better user experience with network error detection
  - **How**: Used `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` with fallback and added network error handling

**Form Validation Enhancement:**
- **File**: `src/features/generation/GenerationForm.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added minimum input length validation (10 characters)
  - **Why**: Prevents poor API calls and guides users to provide adequate detail
  - **How**: Added client-side validation with user-friendly error message

**Test Architecture Improvements:**
- **File**: `src/features/generation/GenerationForm.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed React Testing Library ACT warnings and async test behavior
  - **Why**: Ensures tests accurately reflect user interactions and eliminates console warnings
  - **How**: Wrapped user interactions in `act()` and properly mocked async service calls

- **File**: `src/features/generation/GenerationResult.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed assertions for duplicate text elements
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to shared text content between entities and user roles
  - **How**: Used `getAllByText()` with length assertions for duplicate elements

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **PASS** - All requirements met after refactoring
  - Shared types imported from packages/shared-types ✓

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified.** This is a frontend-only implementation with appropriate separation of concerns. The service layer properly abstracts API calls, and no sensitive data is exposed.

### Performance Considerations

**Performance is appropriate for MVP scope.** The implementation uses efficient React patterns:
- Proper context usage without unnecessary re-renders
- Appropriate component separation
- Lazy loading potential for future expansion

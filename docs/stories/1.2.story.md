# Story 1.2: AI Requirement Extraction

## Status

done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to integrate the backend service with an LLM API,
**so that** I can send a user's text description and receive a structured JSON object of extracted requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The backend service securely connects to a chosen LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
2. The `/api/generate` endpoint takes a text string from the request body.
3. A well-defined prompt is engineered to instruct the LLM to extract the App Name, Entities, Roles, and Features, and to return them in a specific JSON format.
4. The service successfully calls the LLM API with the user's text and returns the structured JSON output.
5. Error handling is implemented for failed API calls to the LLM.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create AI service layer for LLM integration (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [x] Create `src/services/ai.service.ts` file in apps/api
  - [x] Implement secure API key configuration through config service
  - [x] Design structured prompt for extracting GenerationResult components
  - [x] Implement LLM API client with error handling and timeout
  - [x] Add TypeScript interfaces for LLM request/response
- [x] Task 2: Update generate endpoint to use AI service (AC: 2, 4, 5)
  - [x] Modify `/api/generate` endpoint to accept text input from request body
  - [x] Replace hardcoded response with AI service call
  - [x] Implement request validation for text input
  - [x] Add proper error responses for failed LLM calls
- [x] Task 3: Implement error handling and logging (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create database connection setup with Mongoose
  - [x] Implement generation_failures collection model
  - [x] Add error logging service for failed LLM requests
  - [x] Update centralized error middleware for AI-specific errors
- [x] Task 4: Add comprehensive unit testing (Testing Requirements)
  - [x] Create unit tests for ai.service.ts with mocked LLM API
  - [x] Update generate endpoint tests to cover new text input functionality
  - [x] Add tests for error scenarios (invalid input, LLM API failures)
  - [x] Verify all tests use Jest+Supertest with external dependencies mocked

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Successfully implemented Node.js backend API with Express framework
- Created monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types package
- POST /api/generate endpoint exists with hardcoded GenerationResult response
- Configuration service pattern established for environment variables [Source: 1.1.story.md#Dev Agent Record]
- Jest+Supertest testing framework is in place
- Centralized error handling middleware already implemented

### Data Models

**GenerationResult Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#GenerationResult]:

```typescript
export interface GenerationResult {
  appName: string;
  entities: Entity[];
  userRoles: UserRole[];
  features: Feature[];
}
```

**Supporting Interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:

- Entity: { name: string; attributes: string[]; }
- UserRole: { name: string; description: string; }
- Feature: { name: string; description: string; }

**Shared Types Location** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]: These types are already defined in `packages/shared-types` package.

**Database Model for Error Logging** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#generation_failures]:

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "timestamp": "ISODate",
  "userInput": "string",
  "errorSource": "string",
  "errorMessage": "string",
  "llmResponseRaw": "object"
}
```

### API Specifications

**External LLM API Integration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#LLM Provider API]:

- Purpose: To convert user's text into structured GenerationResult JSON object
- Authentication: API key stored securely in Render Environment Group, accessed only by backend
- Integration: Must be wrapped in `ai.service.ts` to isolate provider-specific code
- Service Design: Should make it easier to switch providers in the future

**Endpoint Specifications**:

- Method: POST
- Path: `/api/generate`
- Request Body: `{ text: string }`
- Response: GenerationResult JSON structure
- Error Response: Consistent error format via centralized middleware

### Component Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]: Centralized error-handling middleware for consistent error responses
**Environment Variables** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Must be accessed through config service, not process.env directly
**API Integration** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Service layer must handle external API calls, not controllers
**Naming Conventions** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for types

### Testing

**Test Framework**: Jest (~29.x) and Supertest [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test Location**: Follow standard Jest conventions in `apps/api/src/__tests__/` directory
**Test Requirements**:

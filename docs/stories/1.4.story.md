# Story 1.4: Frontend-Backend Integration

## Status

done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to click the "Generate" button and have my app description sent to the backend,
**so that** the AI processing can begin.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When the "Generate" button is clicked, a `fetch` or `axios` request is made to the backend's `/api/generate` endpoint.
2. The text from the input area is included in the request body.
3. The frontend application correctly receives the JSON response from the backend.
4. The received JSON data is stored in the application's state.
5. A loading indicator is displayed to the user while the request is in progress.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Frontend application with React Context API state management is complete [Source: 1.3.story.md#Dev Agent Record]
- Backend API with POST /api/generate endpoint is functional and tested [Source: 1.2.story.md#Dev Agent Record]
- Service layer exists but currently uses mock implementation [Source: 1.3.story.md#Dev Notes]
- GenerationResult interface is available in shared-types package [Source: 1.2.story.md#Dev Notes]
- Environment configuration pattern using config service is established [Source: 1.1.story.md#Dev Notes]

### Data Models

**Request Interface** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#POST /generate]:

```typescript
interface GenerateRequest {
  prompt: string; // User's app description text
}
```

**Response Interface - GenerationResult** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#GenerationResult]:

```typescript
export interface GenerationResult {
  appName: string;
  entities: Entity[];
  userRoles: UserRole[];
  features: Feature[];
}
```

**Supporting Interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:

- Entity: { name: string; attributes: string[]; }
- UserRole: { name: string; description: string; }
- Feature: { name: string; description: string; }

**Shared Types Location** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]: These types are defined in `packages/shared-types` and must be imported.

### API Specifications

**Backend Endpoint** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#POST /generate]:

- **URL**: `/api/generate`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Request Body**: `{ "prompt": "string" }`
- **Success Response**: 200 with GenerationResult JSON
- **Error Responses**:
  - 429: Rate limit exceeded
  - 500: Server error during generation

**API Base URL** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]: Backend runs on different port, requires environment configuration for frontend-backend communication.

### Component Specifications

**Service Layer Requirements** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Services Layer]:

- Dedicated service layer (`src/services`) must abstract all `fetch` calls
- Components MUST NOT call `fetch` directly [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#API Calls]
- Service must handle error scenarios and network failures

**State Management Integration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State Management]:

- React Context API with application states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`
- State transitions during API calls: idle → loading → success/error
- Error state must distinguish between different failure types

**Frontend Environment Configuration** [Source: 1.1.story.md#Environment Configuration]:

- Environment variables must be accessed through config service pattern
- API URL should be configurable via VITE_API_URL environment variable
- No direct access to `import.meta.env` in components

### File Locations

**Service Layer** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Service layer in `apps/web/src/services/`
**State Management** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Context API state in `apps/web/src/contexts/`
**Components** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Feature components in `apps/web/src/features/generation/`

**Environment Configuration** [Source: 1.1.story.md#Environment Setup]:

- Frontend environment variables in `apps/web/.env.local`
- Config service pattern for centralized environment access

### Testing Requirements

**Frontend Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]: Vitest (~1.x) for testing React components and hooks
**Testing Scope** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]: Unit tests only, with external dependencies mocked
**Test Location**: Follow standard Vitest conventions in `apps/web/src/__tests__/` or co-located with components

**Integration Testing Requirements**:

- Mock backend API responses using fetch mocks or MSW
- Test service layer with various API response scenarios
- Test state management during API call lifecycle
- Test component behavior during loading and error states

### Technical Constraints

**API Communication** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: REST API using fetch (no axios dependency specified)
**Environment Access** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Environment variables must be accessed through config service, not directly
**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]: Must handle centralized error responses from backend
**Type Safety** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Shared types must be imported from packages/shared-types

**Coding Standards Compliance**:

- Service layer MUST abstract all fetch calls [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#API Calls]
- Shared types MUST be imported from `packages/shared-types` [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Types]
- Environment variables MUST use config service pattern [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Environment]
- Standard naming conventions: PascalCase for components/types, camelCase for functions/variables [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming]

### Testing

**Test Framework**: Vitest (~1.x) for React components and service integration [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test Dependencies**: Mock external API calls using fetch mocks or similar [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test Requirements**:

- Integration tests for service layer with various API response scenarios
- State management testing during API call lifecycle (idle → loading → success/error)
- Component testing for loading indicators and error display
- Error handling tests for network failures and HTTP error responses
- Environment configuration testing for API URL setup

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality** - The frontend-backend integration demonstrates professional-grade code with comprehensive error handling, proper architectural patterns, and thorough testing coverage. All acceptance criteria have been met with implementations that exceed baseline requirements.

Key strengths:

- **Robust Service Layer**: GenerationService implements sophisticated retry logic with exponential backoff, proper timeout handling, and comprehensive error categorization
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation between service layer, state management, and UI components following established patterns
- **Type Safety**: Consistent use of shared types from `@mini-ai-app-builder/shared-types` package
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with technical precision for different failure scenarios
- **Configuration Management**: Proper environment variable abstraction through config service

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: apps/web/src/services/generationService.test.ts

- **Change**: Created comprehensive unit tests for the GenerationService
- **Why**: The service layer implementation lacked direct test coverage, which is critical for API integration reliability
- **How**: Added tests covering API contract, timeout mechanisms, error handling structure, and config service integration

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ All standards followed - shared types imported, config service used, service layer abstracts fetch calls, proper naming conventions
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files organized correctly in established directories (services/, contexts/, config/)

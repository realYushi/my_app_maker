# Story 3.1: Tabbed Entity Management Interface

## Status

done

## Story

**As a** user generating AI-powered apps,
**I want** to view and interact with generated entities through a clean tabbed interface instead of the current stacked layout,
**so that** I can easily navigate between different data entities without scrolling through lengthy content and maintain focus on specific entity management tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Replace the current stacked entity display in `GeneratedApp.tsx` with a tabbed interface using HeadlessUI Tab component
2. Each entity should be displayed in its own tab with the entity name as the tab label
3. Tabs should be responsive and work properly on both desktop and mobile devices
4. The active tab should be clearly indicated with visual styling using existing Tailwind CSS classes
5. Entity content should maintain all current context-aware UI generation (e-commerce, user management, admin components)
6. Navigation between tabs should be smooth with proper keyboard accessibility support
7. The interface should handle scaling gracefully - support 1-10+ entities without UI breakdown
8. All existing entity component rendering through the component factory must remain unchanged
9. Mobile devices should provide an intuitive tabbed experience with touch-friendly interactions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Epic 2 Context** [Source: Epic 2]: Epic 2 successfully implemented context-aware UI generation with sophisticated component factory system. Key achievements:

- Context detection service for entity type recognition
- Specialized component factories for e-commerce, user management, and admin domains
- Enhanced UI generation while maintaining backward compatibility with EntityForm.tsx fallback
- 280 tests passing with 95/100 quality score

**Story 2.4 E2E Results** [Source: docs/stories/2.4.story.md]: E2E testing infrastructure fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage validating the complete UI generation pipeline, context detection accuracy, and responsive design across all viewports.

### Architecture Integration Points

**Primary Integration Point** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]: `apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx` (UI orchestration) - main target for tabbed interface implementation at lines 119-126 where entity components are currently rendered in grid layout.

**Current Entity Rendering** [Source: apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx:122-126]: Entities currently displayed in responsive grid:

```
<div className="grid gap-4 sm:gap-6 md:grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-2">
  {entityComponents}
</div>
```

**Component Factory Integration** [Source: apps/web/src/services/componentFactory.tsx]: Dynamic React component generation engine that creates domain-specific UIs based on AI extraction results. The factory routes entities to appropriate components:

- E-commerce entities → Product cards, shopping cart components
- User management entities → User profiles, role management components
- Admin entities → Dashboard components, analytics interfaces
- Unknown entities → EntityForm.tsx fallback

**Error Boundary Pattern** [Source: apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx:58-62]: Each entity wrapped in EntityFormErrorBoundary for production-grade error isolation:

```typescript
<EntityFormErrorBoundary key={`${entity.name}-${index}`}>
  <EntityComponent entity={entity} />
</EntityFormErrorBoundary>
```

### Technical Implementation Details

**HeadlessUI Integration** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]: Tailwind CSS 3.4.0 + HeadlessUI for accessible components already established in tech stack.

**Current Navigation Pattern** [Source: apps/web/src/features/generation/Navigation.tsx]: Existing navigation uses HeadlessUI Disclosure component with responsive mobile/desktop patterns - follow similar accessibility and responsive patterns.

**React Performance Patterns** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]: React optimization with memo, useMemo, useCallback implemented. Current entityComponents memoization at line 54-63 must be preserved:

```typescript
const entityComponents = useMemo(() => {
  return generationResult.entities.map((entity, index) => {
    const EntityComponent = componentFactory.getComponent(
      entity,
      contextResult
    );
    return (
      <EntityFormErrorBoundary key={`${entity.name}-${index}`}>
        <EntityComponent entity={entity} />
      </EntityFormErrorBoundary>
    );
  });
}, [generationResult.entities, contextResult]);
```

### Component Requirements

**HeadlessUI Tab Structure** [Source: HeadlessUI documentation patterns from Navigation.tsx]:

- Tab.Group as container
- Tab.List for tab headers
- Tab for individual tab buttons
- Tab.Panels for content container
- Tab.Panel for individual entity content

**Styling Consistency** [Source: apps/web/src/features/generation/Navigation.tsx:37-41]: Follow existing tab styling patterns from Navigation component:

```typescript
className={`px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors ${
  activeTab === item.id
    ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-700'
    : 'text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-100'
}`}
```

### File Locations

**Main Implementation File** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]: `apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx` - Replace entity grid section (lines 119-126) with tabbed interface implementation.

**Testing Files** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]: Frontend tests in `apps/web/` using Vitest + React Testing Library following established patterns.

### Compatibility Requirements

**Preserving Component Factory** [Source: Epic 3]: All context detection functionality preserved (e-commerce, user management, admin domain detection). Current component factory system maintains all generated components (ProductCard, UserManagement, AdminDashboard, etc.).

**Navigation Functionality** [Source: Epic 3]: Navigation functionality continues working (role/feature switching) - tabbed entity interface should not interfere with top-level Navigation component.

**Responsive Design** [Source: Epic 3]: Using existing Tailwind CSS framework with mobile-first responsive design principles.

### Testing

**Test File Location** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]: Frontend tests should follow established patterns in `apps/web/` directory structure.

**Testing Frameworks** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]: Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing, following existing 280-test patterns.

**E2E Integration** [Source: docs/stories/2.4.story.md]: Story 2.4 established comprehensive E2E testing infrastructure - new tabbed interface should integrate with existing Playwright test suites.

**Performance Testing Requirements** [Source: Epic 3]: Verify interface remains usable on all screen sizes and handles scaling gracefully with 6+ features without UI breakdown.

### Technical Constraints

**No Backend Changes** [Source: Epic 3]: Pure frontend enhancement - no changes to `/api/generate` endpoint or generation flow.

**Type Safety** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]: Shared types package ensures compile-time validation - import types from `packages/shared-types`.

**State Management** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]: React Context API with application states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error` - preserve existing state management patterns.

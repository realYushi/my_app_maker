Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user generating AI-powered apps,
**I want** a responsive navigation hierarchy and optimized feature layout that adapts seamlessly across all screen sizes,
**so that** I can efficiently interact with the app builder interface whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop, and the navigation remains usable even when dealing with apps that have 6+ features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Redesign the navigation hierarchy in `Navigation.tsx` to provide better organization and clearer feature categorization
2. Implement responsive grid layout for features that scales gracefully from mobile (1 column) to desktop (3+ columns)
3. Navigation should handle 6+ features without UI breakdown or becoming unusable on any screen size
4. Add proper touch-friendly interactions for mobile devices with appropriate spacing and tap targets
5. Implement collapsible navigation sections for better space utilization on smaller screens
6. Ensure keyboard navigation and accessibility standards are maintained across all responsive breakpoints
7. Feature display should maintain clear visual hierarchy and readability at all screen sizes
8. Navigation should preserve all existing role/feature switching functionality while improving the layout
9. Test and verify proper responsive behavior across mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+) breakpoints

- Role/feature switching capability
- Current state management patterns
- Integration with component factory system
- Error boundary compatibility

**React Performance** [Source: architecture/architecture.md:112]: React optimization with memo, useMemo, useCallback patterns must be maintained.

**State Management** [Source: architecture/architecture.md:180]: React Context API with application states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error` - preserve existing state management patterns.

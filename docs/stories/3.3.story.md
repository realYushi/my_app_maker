# Story 3.3: Progressive Content Disclosure & Visual Hierarchy

## Status

done

## Story

**As a** user generating AI-powered apps,
**I want** progressive content disclosure with improved typography hierarchy and better content organization,
**so that** I can easily scan, understand, and interact with complex app requirements without being overwhelmed by information density.

## Acceptance Criteria

4. Implement feature details disclosure with expand/collapse functionality for CRUD operations and requirements
5. Create visual indicators for collapsible sections (arrows, plus/minus, etc.) with smooth animations
6. Ensure content organization maintains logical reading flow and information hierarchy
7. Add "overview mode" toggle that allows users to see high-level summary vs. detailed view
8. Implement consistent spacing, margins, and visual grouping throughout the interface

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 3.2 Success** [Source: docs/stories/3.2.story.md]: Successfully implemented responsive navigation and feature layout with HeadlessUI components, establishing strong patterns for:

- HeadlessUI Disclosure components for collapsible sections with proper accessibility
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind CSS breakpoint patterns
- Touch-friendly interactions with proper spacing and animations
- React performance optimization with memo, useMemo, useCallback patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage for responsive behavior

### Architecture Integration Points

**Primary Target Files** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:

- `apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx` - Main UI orchestration where content organization will be enhanced
- `apps/web/src/services/componentFactory.tsx` - Dynamic component generation that may need progressive disclosure patterns

**HeadlessUI Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]: Tailwind CSS 3.4.0 + HeadlessUI for accessible components already established - follow existing Disclosure patterns from Navigation.tsx.

**Current Component Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]: React 18.2.0 with TypeScript + hooks patterns, component factory system for dynamic UI generation.

### Technical Implementation Details

**HeadlessUI Disclosure Pattern** [Source: Previous Story 3.2]:

- Use `Disclosure.Button` for collapsible section headers with proper ARIA labels
- `Disclosure.Panel` for collapsible content areas with smooth transitions
- Implement `transition` classes for smooth animations: `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out`
- Maintain existing accessibility patterns with keyboard navigation support

**Typography Hierarchy Requirements** [Source: Epic 3]:

- Establish clear heading levels: `text-2xl font-bold` (h1), `text-xl font-semibold` (h2), `text-lg font-medium` (h3)
- Consistent spacing: `space-y-4` for content blocks, `mb-2` for headings
- Visual weight: Use `font-semibold` and `text-gray-900` for primary content, `text-gray-600` for secondary

**Responsive Design Classes** [Source: Tailwind CSS patterns]:

- Spacing: `gap-4 sm:gap-6 md:gap-8` for responsive spacing
- Typography scaling: `text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg` for responsive text sizes
- Margins: `mx-4 sm:mx-6 lg:mx-8` for responsive horizontal spacing

### Component Requirements

**Progressive Disclosure Components** [Source: Epic 3]:

- Collapsible app metadata section with overview/detailed toggle
- Entity cards with expandable property details
- Feature sections with collapsible CRUD operations and permissions
- Overview mode toggle for high-level vs. detailed information display

**Visual Indicators** [Source: Epic 3]:

- Chevron icons for expand/collapse states: `ChevronDownIcon` and `ChevronRightIcon` from Heroicons
- Plus/minus indicators for additional content sections
- Smooth rotation animations: `transform transition-transform duration-200`

### File Locations

**Main Implementation Files** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:

- `apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx` - Primary enhancement target for content organization
- `apps/web/src/services/componentFactory.tsx` - May require updates for progressive disclosure in generated components

**Component Files** [Source: Project Structure]:

- `apps/web/src/components/` - Location for reusable disclosure and typography components
- Test files in `apps/web/` using Vitest + React Testing Library following established patterns

### State Management

**React Context Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]: React Context API with application states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error` - preserve existing state management patterns.

**Component State** [Source: HeadlessUI patterns]: Use HeadlessUI Disclosure state management for individual collapsible sections with proper controlled/uncontrolled patterns.

### Testing

**Test Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]: Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing, following existing 280-test patterns.

**Progressive Disclosure Testing Requirements** [Source: Epic 3]:

- Test expand/collapse functionality for all collapsible sections
- Verify accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Validate responsive behavior across mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+) breakpoints
- Test overview/detailed mode toggle functionality
- Verify typography hierarchy and spacing consistency

### Technical Constraints

**No Backend Changes** [Source: Epic 3]: Pure frontend enhancement - no changes to `/api/generate` endpoint or generation flow.

**Performance Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]: Maintain React optimization patterns (memo, useMemo, useCallback) and ensure progressive disclosure doesn't impact rendering performance.

**Accessibility Compliance** [Source: Epic 3]: WCAG compliance required with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support for all collapsible sections.

**Type Safety** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]: Import types from `packages/shared-types` and maintain strict TypeScript compliance.

### Compatibility Requirements

**Preserve Existing Functionality** [Source: Epic 3]:

- All current AI generation and component rendering must remain intact
- Existing navigation and state management patterns must be preserved
- Integration with component factory system must continue working
- Error boundary compatibility must be maintained

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of progressive content disclosure and visual hierarchy. The developer has successfully implemented all 9 acceptance criteria with strong architectural patterns:

- **HeadlessUI Integration**: Proper use of Disclosure components with accessibility features
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Well-designed categorization of essential vs detailed fields in EntityForm

- **Responsive Design**: Comprehensive responsive classes throughout the interface
- **State Management**: Proper React optimization with memo, useMemo, useCallback patterns
- **Visual Organization**: Clear content boundaries, consistent spacing, and logical information flow

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/web/src/features/generation/EntityForm.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed HeadlessUI Disclosure component props from controlled to uncontrolled pattern
  - **Why**: TypeScript compilation errors and proper component state management
  - **How**: Replaced `open={state} onChange={setState}` with `defaultOpen={true}` pattern

- **File**: apps/web/src/features/generation/EntityForm.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Updated test expectations for progressive disclosure behavior and async interactions
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to mismatched expectations about field categorization and HeadlessUI state updates
  - **How**: Fixed text pattern matching for "Additional Fields (n)" format, added proper act() wrappers, and corrected async test handling

- **File**: apps/web/src/features/generation/EntityForm.tsx
  - **Change**: Improved form field accessibility with proper label associations
  - **Why**: Ensures screen reader compatibility and resolves accessibility test requirements
  - **How**: Added unique IDs (summary-, essential-, detailed-) to differentiate fields in different view modes

# Story 1.5: Dynamic UI Generation

## Status

done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see a mock UI rendered on the screen based on the requirements extracted by the AI,
**so that** I can visualize my app idea.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The extracted App Name is displayed as a title on the page.
2. A navigation menu or tab bar is dynamically created with items for each extracted Role and Feature.
3. For each extracted Entity, a non-functional form is rendered on the page, containing a generic set of input fields.
4. The entire generated UI replaces or appears alongside the initial text input area.
5. The display is responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile screens.
6. If the backend returns an error, a user-friendly error message is displayed instead of the mock UI.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create GeneratedApp component to display the complete mock UI (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create main GeneratedApp component in features/generation
  - [x] Display app name as prominent title/header

  - [x] Create Navigation component with dynamic tab/menu generation
  - [x] Generate navigation items from userRoles and features arrays
  - [x] Implement accessible navigation using Headless UI components
  - [x] Add responsive navigation (mobile-friendly hamburger menu)
- [x] Task 3: Create dynamic entity forms for each extracted entity (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create EntityForm component for rendering non-functional forms
  - [x] Generate form fields based on entity attributes array
  - [x] Style forms using Tailwind CSS for consistent appearance
  - [x] Ensure forms are non-functional (display only, no submission logic)
- [x] Task 4: Implement responsive design and error handling (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Ensure all components are responsive across desktop and mobile
  - [x] Create error display component for backend failures
  - [x] Test responsive behavior using Tailwind's responsive utilities

### Previous Story Insights

- Frontend-backend integration complete with robust error handling [Source: 1.4.story.md#Dev Agent Record]
- Service layer uses shared types from packages/shared-types [Source: 1.4.story.md#Dev Notes]

### Data Models

**GenerationResult Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#GenerationResult]:

```typescript
export interface GenerationResult {
  appName: string;
  entities: Entity[];
  userRoles: UserRole[];
  features: Feature[];
}
```

**Supporting Interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:

```typescript
export interface Entity {
  name: string;
  attributes: string[];
}

export interface UserRole {
  name: string;
  description: string;
}

export interface Feature {
  name: string;
  description: string;
}
```

**Shared Types Location** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]: These types are defined in `packages/shared-types` and must be imported.

### Component Specifications

**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]: Feature-based folder structure in `src/features/generation`

**State Management Integration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]: React Context API with application states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`

**UI Component Library** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: Tailwind CSS (~3.x) + Headless UI (~2.x) for styling and accessible unstyled components

**Component Rendering Strategy** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]: Root `App.tsx` component conditionally renders views based on application state

**Responsive Design Requirements** [Source: 1.5 Epic Requirements]: Display must be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile screens

### File Locations

**Component Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Feature components in `apps/web/src/features/generation/`

**Main App Component** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]: Root `App.tsx` for conditional rendering based on state

**Shared Types Import** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Import from `packages/shared-types`

### Testing Requirements

**Frontend Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]: Vitest (~1.x) for testing React components and hooks

**Testing Scope** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]: Unit tests only, with external dependencies mocked

**Test Location**: Follow standard Vitest conventions in `apps/web/src/__tests__/` or co-located with components

**Component Testing Requirements**:

- Test component rendering with various GenerationResult data structures
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Test error state handling when GenerationResult is unavailable
- Test integration with AppContext state management
- Test accessibility of navigation components using Headless UI

### Technical Constraints

**UI Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: React (~18.x) with TypeScript (~5.x)

**Styling Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: Tailwind CSS (~3.x) for styling, Headless UI (~2.x) for accessible components

**State Access** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]: Components must access GenerationResult through React Context API, not direct props

**Type Safety** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Shared types must be imported from packages/shared-types

**Responsive Design** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: Use Tailwind CSS responsive utilities for mobile-first design

**Coding Standards Compliance**:

- Components must use PascalCase naming [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming]
- Functions and variables must use camelCase [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming]
- Shared types must be imported from `packages/shared-types` [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Types]
- No direct fetch calls in components [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#API Calls]

### Testing

**Test Framework**: Vitest (~1.x) for React components and hooks [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Requirements**:

- Unit tests for GeneratedApp component with various GenerationResult inputs
- Navigation component tests with different combinations of roles and features
- EntityForm component tests with various entity attribute structures
- Responsive design tests using Tailwind's responsive breakpoints
- Error state tests when backend data is unavailable or invalid
- Integration tests with AppContext state management
- Accessibility tests for navigation components using Headless UI

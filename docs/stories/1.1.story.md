# Story 1.1: Backend Service Setup

## Status

done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up a basic Node.js server with a single API endpoint,
**so that** I have a foundation for handling future requests from the frontend.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A Node.js project is initialized with necessary dependencies (e.g., Express).
2. A single POST endpoint (e.g., `/api/generate`) is created.
3. When the endpoint receives a request, it returns a hardcoded JSON response that mimics the expected structure (App Name, Entities, Roles, Features).
4. A basic unit test is in place to verify the endpoint returns the correct mock response and a 200 status code.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Initialize Node.js project structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `apps/api/` directory following project structure
  - [x] Initialize package.json with Express dependency (~4.x)
  - [x] Set up TypeScript configuration (~5.x)
  - [x] Install required dependencies (Express, TypeScript, @types packages)
- [x] Task 2: Create POST endpoint with mock response (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Set up Express server with basic configuration
  - [x] Create `/api/generate` POST endpoint
  - [x] Implement hardcoded response matching GenerationResult interface
  - [x] Add centralized error handling middleware
- [x] Task 3: Implement unit testing (AC: 4)
  - [x] Set up Jest testing framework (~29.x)
  - [x] Install Supertest for API testing
  - [x] Create test file for `/api/generate` endpoint
  - [x] Verify endpoint returns correct mock response and 200 status

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models

**GenerationResult Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#GenerationResult]:

```typescript
export interface GenerationResult {
  appName: string;
  entities: Entity[];
  userRoles: UserRole[];
  features: Feature[];
}
```

**Supporting Interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:

- Entity: { name: string; attributes: string[]; }
- UserRole: { name: string; description: string; }
- Feature: { name: string; description: string; }

**Shared Types Location** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]: These types must be defined in `packages/shared-types` package for sharing between frontend and backend.

### API Specifications

**Endpoint Details** [Source: epic-1-core-ai-to-ui-generation.md]:

- Method: POST
- Path: `/api/generate`
- Response: Hardcoded JSON matching GenerationResult structure

### Component Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### File Locations

**Backend Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Backend code should be placed in `apps/api/` directory
**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

```
apps/
└── api/      # Backend Node.js (Express) application
packages/
└── shared-types/  # Shared TypeScript interfaces
```

### Testing Requirements

**Backend Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]: Jest and Supertest for testing API controllers and services in isolation, with external dependencies mocked.
**Testing Scope** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]: Unit tests only, as per the PRD.

### Technical Constraints

**Backend Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: Express.js ~4.x for web server framework
**Language** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: TypeScript ~5.x for backend development
**Architecture Pattern** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]: Standard Model-Service-Controller pattern within Express application
**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]: Centralized error-handling middleware for consistent error responses
**Environment Variables** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Must be accessed through a config service, not process.env directly
**Naming Conventions** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for types

### Testing

**Test Framework**: Jest (~29.x) and Supertest [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test Location**: Follow standard Jest conventions in `apps/api/` directory
**Test Requirements**:

- Unit tests for API controllers and services in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify endpoint returns correct mock response and 200 status code

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality overall. Clean, well-structured Node.js/Express API following standard patterns. Strong adherence to requirements with comprehensive test coverage. Code is readable, maintainable, and follows TypeScript best practices.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/api/src/config/index.ts

  - **Change**: Created configuration service to centralize environment variable access
  - **Why**: Story violated coding standards by accessing process.env.PORT directly in index.ts
  - **How**: Extracted config service and updated index.ts to use it, maintaining separation of concerns

- **File**: apps/api/src/index.ts
  - **Change**: Updated to use config service instead of direct process.env access
  - **Why**: Ensures compliance with coding standards requirement
  - **How**: Import config service and reference config.port instead of process.env.PORT

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ [Fixed direct process.env access violation]
- Project Structure: ✓ [Perfect monorepo structure with shared-types]
- Testing Strategy: ✓ [Jest+Supertest as specified, comprehensive coverage]
- All ACs Met: ✓ [All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested]

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed coding standards violation (config service implementation)
- [x] Verified all tests pass after refactoring
- [x] Confirmed API endpoint returns correct mock structure
- [x] Validated TypeScript interfaces match requirements

### Security Review

No security concerns for this foundational story. Mock endpoint appropriately returns hardcoded data with no user input processing. Error handling middleware properly structured for future security considerations.

### Performance Considerations

Lightweight implementation appropriate for MVP foundation. Mock response is efficiently structured. Server properly configured for testing isolation (conditional startup).

### Files Modified During Review

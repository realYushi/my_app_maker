# Story 2.1: Context Detection & Component Framework

## Status

done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to build an entity type detection service and component factory system for specialized UI generation,
**so that** the application can generate context-aware, domain-appropriate mockups based on extracted entity types.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An entity type detection service analyzes entities from GenerationResult and categorizes them into domain contexts (e-commerce, user management, admin, generic).
2. A component factory system routes entities to specialized UI components based on detected context.
3. The enhanced GeneratedApp component integrates context detection while preserving existing EntityForm fallback for unknown entity types.
4. Context detection service identifies common e-commerce entities (products, orders, customers, inventory) and user management entities (users, profiles, roles, permissions).
5. The system maintains backward compatibility with existing GenerationResult data structure and navigation functionality.
6. All existing 81 tests continue passing, with new tests added for context detection and component factory logic.

### Data Models

**GenerationResult Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-apis.md]:

```typescript
export interface GenerationResult {
  appName: string;
  entities: Entity[];
  userRoles: UserRole[];
  features: Feature[];
}
```

**Supporting Interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-apis.md]:

```typescript
export interface Entity {
  name: string;
  attributes: string[];
}

export interface UserRole {
  name: string;
  description: string;
}

export interface Feature {
  name: string;
  description: string;
}
```

**Shared Types Location** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: These types are defined in `packages/shared-types` and must be imported, no direct fetch calls allowed.

### API Specifications

**No API Changes Required** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: Existing `/api/generate` endpoint and AI extraction pipeline remain unchanged for this story.

**Service Layer Pattern** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Frontend components must use service layer abstraction, not direct fetch calls.

### Component Specifications

**Primary Integration Point** [Source: Epic 2]: `apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx` (UI orchestration) - identified as most likely to change area.

**Secondary Integration Point** [Source: Epic 2]: `apps/web/src/features/generation/EntityForm.tsx` (smart form generation) - must be preserved as fallback system.

**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Feature-based folder structure in `src/features/generation` with established patterns.

**State Management Integration** [Source: architecture/quick-reference-key-files-and-entry-points.md]: React Context API with application states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`.

**UI Component Library** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: Tailwind CSS (~3.4.0) + Headless UI for styling and accessible components.

### File Locations

**Service Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: New services in `apps/web/src/services/` following existing generationService.ts patterns.

**Component Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Feature components in `apps/web/src/features/generation/` with established organization.

**Type Definitions** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: New interfaces in `packages/shared-types` or component-specific types in local files.

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: Vitest for React components and services with React Testing Library.

**Test Coverage Requirements** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: All existing 81 tests must continue passing + comprehensive new test coverage.

**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: Component tests co-located with components in `apps/web/src/` following established patterns.

**Testing Scope** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: Unit tests with external dependencies mocked, integration testing for service interaction.

### Technical Constraints

**Backward Compatibility** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: No changes to GenerationResult, Entity, UserRole, or Feature interfaces in packages/shared-types.

**Architecture Compliance** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: Enhancement follows established monorepo structure and React/Tailwind patterns.

**Performance Requirement** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: Maintains current generation speed with improved visual output.

**UI Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: React (~18.2.0) with TypeScript, Vite build tool (~7.1.2).

**Styling Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: Tailwind CSS (~3.4.0) for styling, responsive design patterns.

**Navigation Preservation** [Source: Epic 2 Definition of Done]: Dynamic navigation from Navigation.tsx must continue working without regression.

### Testing

**Test Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library for component and service testing [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]

**Test Requirements**:

- Unit tests for ContextDetectionService with various entity type combinations
- ComponentFactory tests with different domain contexts and edge cases

- Integration tests for context detection → component factory → UI rendering workflow
- Regression testing to ensure all existing 81 tests continue passing

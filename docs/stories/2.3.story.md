### Data Models

**GenerationResult Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-apis.md]:

```typescript
export interface GenerationResult {
  appName: string;
  entities: Entity[];
  userRoles: UserRole[];
  features: Feature[];
}
```

**Supporting Interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-apis.md]:

```typescript
export interface Entity {
  name: string;
  attributes: string[];
}

export interface UserRole {
  name: string;
  description: string;
}

export interface Feature {
  name: string;
  description: string;
}
```

**Context Detection Types** [Source: apps/web/src/services/contextDetectionService.ts]:

```typescript
export interface ContextDetectionResult {
  primaryContext: DomainContext;
  contextScores: ContextScore[];
  entityDomainMap: Map<string, DomainContext>;
}
```

**Shared Types Location** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: These types are defined in `packages/shared-types` and must be imported, no direct fetch calls allowed.

### API Specifications

**No API Changes Required** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: Existing `/api/generate` endpoint and AI extraction pipeline remain unchanged for this story.

**Service Layer Pattern** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Frontend components must use service layer abstraction, not direct fetch calls.

### Component Specifications

**Primary Integration Point** [Source: Epic 2]: `apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx` (UI orchestration) - where new components will be rendered.

**Component Factory Extension** [Source: apps/web/src/services/componentFactory.tsx]: Existing ComponentFactory class with registry pattern for domain-specific routing.

**Existing User Management Component Patterns** [Source: apps/web/src/services/componentFactory.tsx]:

- UserManagementUserForm: Basic user interface with indigo styling and user account badge
- UserManagementRoleForm: Role management interface with yellow styling and access control badge

**Existing Admin Component Patterns** [Source: apps/web/src/services/componentFactory.tsx]:

- AdminSystemForm: System administration interface with red styling and system admin badge
- AdminReportForm: Analytics interface with orange styling and analytics & reports badge

**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Feature-based folder structure in `src/features/generation` with established patterns.

**State Management Integration** [Source: architecture/quick-reference-key-files-and-entry-points.md]: React Context API with application states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`.

**UI Component Library** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: Tailwind CSS (~3.4.0) + Headless UI for styling and accessible components.

### File Locations

**New Component Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: New user management and admin components in `apps/web/src/features/generation/user-management/` and `apps/web/src/features/generation/admin/` following established feature organization.

**Component Factory Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Extend existing `apps/web/src/services/componentFactory.tsx` with new component registrations.

**Type Definitions** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: New interfaces in component-specific files or extend shared-types if needed across modules.

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: Vitest for React components and services with React Testing Library.

**Test Coverage Requirements** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: All existing tests must continue passing + comprehensive new test coverage.

**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: Component tests co-located with components in `apps/web/src/` following established patterns.

**Testing Scope** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: Unit tests with external dependencies mocked, integration testing for component factory routing.

### Technical Constraints

**Backward Compatibility** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: No changes to GenerationResult, Entity, UserRole, or Feature interfaces in packages/shared-types.

**Architecture Compliance** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: Enhancement follows established monorepo structure and React/Tailwind patterns.

**Performance Requirement** [Source: Epic 2 Compatibility Requirements]: Maintains current generation speed with improved visual output.

**UI Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: React (~18.2.0) with TypeScript, Vite build tool (~7.1.2).

**Styling Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: Tailwind CSS (~3.4.0) for styling, responsive design patterns.

**Navigation Preservation** [Source: Epic 2 Definition of Done]: Dynamic navigation from Navigation.tsx must continue working without regression.

### Testing

**Test Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library for component and service testing [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]

**Test Requirements**:

- Unit tests for new user management and admin components (UserProfile, AdminDashboard, RolePermissionPanel, etc.)
- Component factory tests for user management and admin entity routing and fallback behavior
- Integration tests for context detection → component factory → user management/admin UI rendering workflow
- Responsive design testing across desktop and mobile viewports
- Regression testing to ensure all existing tests continue passing
- Component interaction testing for admin dashboard and user management functionality

**Test Organization**: Co-located with components in `apps/web/src/features/generation/user-management/` and `apps/web/src/features/generation/admin/` following project conventions [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Epic 2 Context** [Source: Epic 2]: This is the final story in Epic 2 which has successfully implemented context-aware UI generation. Previous stories have established:

- Context detection service for entity type recognition
- Specialized component factories for e-commerce, user management, and admin domains
- Enhanced UI generation while maintaining backward compatibility with EntityForm.tsx fallback

**Story 2.3 QA Results** [Source: docs/qa/gates/2.3-user-management-admin-components.yml]: Story 2.3 passed QA with exceptional quality:

- 257 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Quality score: 95/100 with comprehensive functionality
- E2E validation performed with restaurant management app scenarios
- Context detection accurately routes entities to appropriate domain components
- Key finding: Simple prompts cause server errors - system requires detailed, feature-rich descriptions for AI processing

### Testing Framework and Infrastructure

**E2E Testing Available** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: Playwright MCP is available for browser automation and end-to-end testing integration.

**Current Test Suite Status** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: 81 comprehensive tests currently passing with complete backend and frontend unit test coverage.

**Story 2.3 Test Baseline** [Source: docs/qa/gates/2.3-user-management-admin-components.yml]: Most recent implementation achieved 257 tests passing with 100% pass rate, establishing new baseline for E2E validation.

**Testing Frameworks** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:

- **API Tests**: Jest with supertest for HTTP testing
- **Frontend Tests**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright MCP for browser automation via MCP integration

**Missing Coverage** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: E2E Tests are the identified gap - "Playwright MCP available, test scenarios need implementation ✅⚠️"

### Architecture Integration Points

**Primary Integration Points** [Source: Epic 2]:

- `apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx` (UI orchestration) - main testing target
- `apps/web/src/features/generation/EntityForm.tsx` (smart form generation fallback)
- `apps/web/src/services/generationService.ts` (API abstraction layer)

**Service Layer Pattern** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Frontend components use service layer abstraction, not direct fetch calls - critical for test mocking.

**State Management** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: React Context API with application states: `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error` - test state transitions.

### Application Architecture Context

**Monorepo Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

- `apps/api/` - Express backend on port 3001
- `apps/web/` - React frontend on port 5173
- `packages/shared-types/` - Shared TypeScript interfaces

**Development Servers** [Source: Epic 2]:

- Backend: Express server on port 3001 with Google Gemini AI integration
- Frontend: React 18/TypeScript on port 5173 with Vite, Tailwind CSS 3.4.0

### Component Factory System

**Component Routing Logic** [Source: Previous Stories]: Enhanced component factory system routes entities to specialized components:

- E-commerce entities → Product cards, shopping cart components
- User management entities → User profiles, role management components
- Admin entities → Dashboard components, analytics interfaces
- Unknown entities → EntityForm.tsx fallback

### Testing Requirements

**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]: Tests should follow the established patterns with proper separation between unit, integration, and E2E tests.

**Compatibility Requirements** [Source: Epic 2]: All existing 81 tests must continue passing + comprehensive new test coverage for enhanced features.

**Performance Baseline** [Source: Epic 2]: Generation speed must be maintained or improved compared to current baseline.

### Technical Constraints

**No Database Dependencies** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]: MongoDB is available but disabled - E2E tests should not rely on database state.

**AI Service Integration** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]: Google Gemini integration with mock mode for development/testing when API key not configured.

**Shared Types** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]: Types must be imported from `packages/shared-types`, no direct API calls from components.

### Testing

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]:

- E2E tests should be organized appropriately within the monorepo structure
- Follow established patterns for test organization and naming

**Test Frameworks** [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]:

- Playwright MCP for E2E browser automation
- Integration with existing Jest (API) and Vitest (frontend) test suites

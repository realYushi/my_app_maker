- **TypeScript Excellence**: Comprehensive typing with clear interfaces and proper type safety
- **Test Coverage**: 60 comprehensive tests across all components with edge case coverage
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering patterns and memoization strategies

### Refactoring Performed

During the review, I identified and resolved several code quality issues that could impact reliability and maintainability:

- **File**: `apps/web/src/features/generation/ecommerce/ProductCard.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced `Math.random() > 0.7` with deterministic logic `mockPrice < 100` for discount display
  - **Why**: Non-deterministic behavior caused flaky test results and inconsistent UI rendering
  - **How**: Used price-based logic to ensure consistent behavior while maintaining visual variety

- **File**: `apps/web/src/features/generation/ecommerce/CatalogGrid.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced `Math.random() > 0.1` with `index < entities.length * 0.9` for stock status
  - **Why**: Non-deterministic behavior made testing unreliable and user experience inconsistent
  - **How**: Used index-based calculation to maintain 90% in-stock rate deterministically

- **File**: `apps/web/src/features/generation/ecommerce/CheckoutFlow.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced `Math.random().toString(36)` with `Date.now().toString(36)` for order number generation
  - **Why**: Improved uniqueness and made order numbers more predictable for testing
  - **How**: Time-based generation ensures uniqueness while being deterministic in test environments

- **File**: `apps/web/src/features/generation/ecommerce/ProductCard.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Updated test selectors to handle multiple price elements and fixed ambiguous "Out of Stock" text selection
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to multiple elements matching selectors, causing false negatives
  - **How**: Used more specific selectors (getAllByText, getByRole) and CSS selectors for unique identification

- **File**: `apps/web/src/services/componentFactory.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated test expectations to reflect enhanced e-commerce components instead of basic EntityForm
  - **Why**: Tests were checking for outdated component text after implementing enhanced components
  - **How**: Updated assertions to verify "🛍️ Product Card" and enhanced component features

- **File**: `apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Updated component factory integration tests to expect enhanced e-commerce components
  - **Why**: Tests expected mocked EntityForm but Product entities now route to EcommerceProductDisplay
  - **How**: Changed assertions to verify enhanced component rendering (Product Card, Add to Cart button)

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ **PASS** - Excellent adherence to React/TypeScript best practices, consistent naming conventions, proper component organization
- **Project Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Perfect alignment with feature-based organization, proper imports and exports

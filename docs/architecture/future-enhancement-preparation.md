# Future Enhancement Preparation

## Epic 2 Readiness

**Database Integration**:
- MongoDB connection code exists but disabled
- Models defined and ready for activation
- Error logging service ready for database storage

**E2E Testing Requirements** ✅⚠️:
- **Playwright MCP available** - infrastructure ready for end-to-end testing
- Test scenarios needed: Complete user flow from input to generated UI
- Browser automation capabilities already accessible

**Deployment Readiness for Render CI/CD**:
- Build process ready for cloud deployment
- Environment variable configuration needed
- CORS and port configuration updates required
- Database connection activation needed

## Areas Most Likely to Change

1. **UI Generation Logic** (`apps/web/src/features/generation/GeneratedApp.tsx`)
2. **AI Service Integration** (`apps/api/src/services/ai.service.ts`)
3. **Database Models** (when persistence is enabled)
4. **Styling and Component Library** (potential UI framework changes)

# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Mini AI App Builder, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a greenfield project with no pre-existing codebase or mandated starter template. Based on the specified technology stack (React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS) and the monorepo structure required by the PRD, we have selected a foundation to accelerate setup and ensure efficient management.

**Decision:** We will proceed with a greenfield setup using **Turborepo** on top of **npm workspaces** to initialize and manage the monorepo. This provides a high-performance build system that is fully compatible with deployment to Render.

# Backend Architecture

- **Structure:** A standard Model-Service-Controller pattern will be used within the Express application.
- **Database:** Mongoose will be used as the ODM to interact with MongoDB.
- **Error Handling:** A centralized error-handling middleware will be used to ensure consistent error responses.

### Test Case 3: Role Permission Panel Interactions ✅

**Objective**: Test role-based permission management and dynamic UI updates

**Steps**:

1. Locate Role Permissions section
2. Verify initial Admin role selected
3. Click Manager role button
4. Verify permission changes
5. Check permission summary updates

**Results**:

- ✅ Admin role initially selected showing "👑 Admin Role Configuration"
- ✅ Manager role selection functional - button becomes active
- ✅ Role configuration header updates to "🔧 Manager Role Configuration"
- ✅ Permission matrix shows different permissions for Manager vs Admin
- ✅ Permission summary correctly updates: "Manager role has 7 out of 13 total permissions" vs "Admin role has 13 out of 13 total permissions"
- ✅ Visual indicators show missing permissions for Manager role (grayed out icons)

### Test Case 4: Admin Dashboard Navigation ✅

**Objective**: Test navigation and feature discovery for admin components

**Steps**:

1. Locate navigation panel
2. Click "Admin Dashboard Feature" button
3. Verify feature activation and description
4. Click "Data Visualization Feature" button
5. Verify feature switching

**Results**:

- ✅ Navigation panel displays all 8 features with proper labels
- ✅ Admin Dashboard Feature button becomes active when clicked
- ✅ Feature description appears: "Provides a centralized view of system metrics and user activity"
- ✅ Data Visualization Feature activation works properly
- ✅ Feature description updates: "Visual representation of system metrics and user activity through charts and graphs"
- ✅ Navigation state properly maintained between feature switches

### Test Case 5: Component Factory Integration ✅

**Objective**: Verify enhanced component factory routing and context detection

**Steps**:

1. Verify User entity routed to UserActivityFeed component
2. Verify Role entity routed to RolePermissionPanel component
3. Check context detection accuracy
4. Validate component type indicators

**Results**:

- ✅ User entity correctly routed to sophisticated UserActivityFeed component with 📊 User Activity indicator
- ✅ Role entity correctly routed to RolePermissionPanel component with 🔐 Access Control indicator
- ✅ Context detection shows "USER MANAGEMENT (3 matched entities)" - highly accurate
- ✅ Component type indicators properly displayed for each entity
- ✅ Fallback EntityForm components displayed for SystemMetric and UserActivity entities
